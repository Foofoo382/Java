     <string name="message_tellafriend">If you have kids, you know what
         happens when we give them our phone or tablets. They will download
     a  game which they use only once and then they move on to the next game which
     is downloaded too, this way cluttering the device memory
         with games and their icons.\n
     This app helps you look at all newly installed apps, and uninstall them
     at one go (You do have to confirm each uninstall individually).
     Go ahead, try this out and not be afraid of giving your device to your kids
         anymore.</string>
