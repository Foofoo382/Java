    <string name="message_tellafriend">The coju.mobi Video Grater app can extract
        still pictures (in PNG format) from any video file (MP4,3GP and WEBM formats are supported). Itâ€™s simple user interface searches for all video files in your
        device and lists them in scrollable view. You can then select a video file
        and specify from what time in the video you want to extract pictures. You
        can also extract multiple pictures at a time by specifying the number of
        pictures and time separation between them.

        The extracted still pictures can be saved in device storage or can be shared
        with others using email or text messages. You can also store the extracted
        images in the cloud.
