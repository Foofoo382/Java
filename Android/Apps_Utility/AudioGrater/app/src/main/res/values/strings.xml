    <string name="message_tellafriend">The coju.mobi™ Audio Grater app creates smaller audio file(s)
        (in M4A format) from any large audio file (M4A, MP3, WAV and OGG formats
        are supported). It’s simple user interface searches for all audio files
        in your device and lists them in a scrollable view. You can then select
        an audio file and specify the start time and duration of each smaller
        audio file(s) you want created. This app will then automatically create
        the smaller audio file(s), with a different name depending on the start
        time (in seconds) of that smaller audio file.
