       Ever wanted calls from certain contacts in your phone book to never ring?
        You now have a solution with this Call Block app.

        The Call Block app has two views one for unblocked and another for
        blocked contacts. The unblocked contacts view displays all your stored
        contacts whose calls are not blocked, while the blocked view displays
        stored contacts calls from whom are blocked. To block one or contacts,
        you simply go to the unblocked view and selected the contacts you want
        to block. Then using the block option you can block calls from all those
        contacts with a single tap.
