        As you may know large vCard files can be difficult to import in Android
        phones, or even in applications like Microsoft Outlook.
        Wouldn\'t it be nice to break a large vCard file with several contacts into
        multiple smaller vCard files that you can transfer or import easily?
        The vCard Splitter app is now here to help you with that.

        This vCard Splitter app allows you to split a single vCard file into multiple
        vCard files, and you can specify how many vCard files to split into. The
        contacts will be equally divided between each file.

        You can also split each contact into its own individual vCard file,
        allowing you to easily import the contacts in programs which may not
        be able to import vCard files with multiple contacts, like Microsoft
        Outlook.

        Try out this app today.
