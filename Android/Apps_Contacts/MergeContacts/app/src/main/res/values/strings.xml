        This useful app simplifies your contacts list by merging contacts details
        like phone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses into one.

        This save you a lot of time as the only other way is
        to move the contacts details manually, and then delete the other contacts.

        Apart from this you can also Add/Edit contacts, make calls, send message
        and search for contacts.</string>
