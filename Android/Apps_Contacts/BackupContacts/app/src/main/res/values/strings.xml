        Your contacts are probably the most important information in your phone,
        and it takes a lot of time to build up a contacts list.
        You do not want to lose them if your phone gets lost, or you accidentally
        remove all your contacts.

        This is where this app comes in to play. It can back-up all
        your contacts in a file and allows you to place the backup file on your phone, or
        on the Internet in your own private email or cloud. Using the restore
        feature of this app, the backup
        file can be used to restore contacts in any Android device, anytime.

        There are other apps out there that charge you an annual fees
        to store your contacts in the cloud, but you do not need
        to pay the fee since you already get free email and cloud storage
        with several free providers like Google, and this app allows you
        to leverage your free accounts.

        Download this app now and get the peace of mind that your contacts
        will always be safe!
