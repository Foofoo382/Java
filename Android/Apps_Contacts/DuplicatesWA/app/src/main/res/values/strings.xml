    <string name="app_name">Duplicates for WhatsApp</string>
    <string name="message_tellafriend">With this app you can view duplicate WhatsApp contacts,
            select and delete them. Duplicate WhatsApp contacts are identified by a unique color
        scheme which helps you to view the master value and its associated duplicates. All duplicates
        are auto-selected for deletion, but you have the choice of un-selecting them in case
        you wish to keep some of the contacts.
        This app also comes with a dialer allowing you to make calls to your contacts and also has features to
        add new contacts and edit existing ones.</string>
