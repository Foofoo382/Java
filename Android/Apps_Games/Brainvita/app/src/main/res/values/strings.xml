    <string name="app_name">Peg Solitaire Solver</string>
    <string name="message_tellafriend">This app is the mentally challening game of
        Peg Solitaire also known as Marble solitaire or Brainvita. The goal of the game is
        to get to the minimum number of pegs as possible. Pegs are moved to an empty hole after jumping over
        another peg in a straight line. The peg jumped over is removed, this way
        after each move the number of pegs are reduced by one.\n\n
        Apart from playing the standard game, this app allows you to set your own
        custom board to solve. There are Back and Forward buttons which allow you go back to
        any number of moves and the game also keeps high scores.\n\n
        However, what makes this app truely unique is its powerful peg solitaire solver. The solver
        uses a propriety \'state-space\' algorithm to solve any given board. The solver will
        come up with all the moves that are required to come to the minimum possible number of pegs.
        If you run the solver from the beginning on a new board it will show you all the moves that will
        lead to one peg. Because it finds a solution to any board, the solver can take a few minutes to come to
        a solution.\n\n
        Give it a try !\n</string>
